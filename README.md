<h1>Omega Game</h1>
OMEGA was created as a study of complexity and intuitive arithmetic. Both ideas came together to form this tiny creature. It looks like a mix between Hex and Go. <br />
On OMEGA, players aim to earn the most points by forming groups of respective colors by arranging stones in a hexagonal grid. However, each participant places stones of all colors in play. <br />
The final score for each color is calculated by multiplying the sizes of the different groups of that color. <br />
It may be played on a variety of board sizes thanks to the game's six acrylic "corners." <br />
You will quickly learn that you do not need to evaluate your score while playing (multiplying your group values). Instead, employ an appropriate technique. How? You must solve the problem on your own.<br />
OMEGA was originally intended for two players, however it also can be played with 3, 4 players.
